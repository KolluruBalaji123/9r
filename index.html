        Tarak collaborated with director Rajamouli for the third time for a socio-fantasy film Yamadonga.
         For this film, he had to sport a new look by shedding more than 20 kg, as he used to be 94 kg. RamaRao played Raja, a 
         thief who later criticizes and insults Yama and then suddenly goes into hell due to some bad acts. 
         The film received positive reviews and made him receive Filmfare Award for Best Actor â€“ Telugu. Actor 
         Mohan Babu praised Rao's performance in the film. Rao later signed up for the action film Kantri which was directed by 
         debutant Meher Ramesh, a protege of Puri Jagannadh. In 2009,
         Rao took a year hiatus to campaign for Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the 2009 general elections
